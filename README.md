To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### How to Run the Code

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project folder. Run the Python scripts using the following command:

```bash
python filename.py


What's Inside
Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:
* Basic Concepts: Simple Python scripts demonstrating fundamental concepts.
