# STATEMENTS IN PYTHON - An instruction for the computer to do something 

# for example
name="Abhas"   
print(name)

#statement vs Expression 

# A statement is a line of code that performs some action whereas an Expression is evaluated for a result 

# for example
x=10 # is a statement 
x = x+3 # is also a statement  but "x+3" is an expressions 

#Multi Line Statements - statements can be extended using continuation character (\), paranthesis (),Square Brackets [] or Curly brackets{}

#FOR EXAMPLE
x=10+20+30 \
    +40+50+60+ \
        70+50
print(x)

x=(1+3+4+
   5+6+
   6+2)
print(x)

x=["Abhas"
   ,"jaiswal","AJ"]
print(x)

# similarly we can use curly brackets too
