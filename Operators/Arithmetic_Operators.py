"An Operator is a special symbol that performs ann operation on operands"

"An Operand is a value/variable to which the operation is applied."

#List of Arithmetic Operators
# Adition and Unary Plus (+)
x=5
y=6
print(x+y)
print(+x)

# Subtraction and Unary Minus (-)
print(x-y)
print(-x)

# Multiplication (*)
print(x*y)

# Division (/)
print(x/y)

# Floor Division (//)
print(x//y)


# Modulus (%)
print(x%y)

# Power (**)
print(x**2)

# ()                           Left to Right
# **                           Right to left
# +x and -x                    Left to Right
# * , /, //, and %             Left to Right 
# + and -                      Left to Right 

# FOR EXAMPLE 
print(10+5-8/2)  # 8/2 will be evaluated first and then 10+5
