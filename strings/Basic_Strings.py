#A string is a sequence of characters. It can be enclosed in a single or double quotes or vice versa

#for example

statement="The language python is named after Monty Python"
print(statement)

#if single quotes are used inside the string then the string should be enclosed within double quotes or vice versa

#for example
# statement= "Hello, "I am Abhas Jaiswal". How's your Health?" will throw error 
# Alternatively single or double quotes within a string can be escaped using backslash character

statement2="Hello,\"I am Abhas Jaiswal\".How's your health?"
print(statement2)

#Now that we know single line string , Lets read about Multiline string

#A multi-line string is enclosed in triple-single or double quotes 
#for example

statement3="""Hello world!
This is Abhas Jaiswal 
How are you?"""
print(statement3)
